    <h5>JOB POSITION</h5>
    <h6>Company Name<br>Company Location</h6>
    <p>Reading the job application may seem like an obvious step but people frequently skip it. 
        Even if you scanned the job description before you decided to apply.
        It is still a good idea to go back and read it a couple of more times to make sure you did not miss any details. 
        <br>Employers typically receive hundreds of applications for a position. 
        One of the most common methods they will use to narrow the applicant pool is to eliminate anyone. 
        The one who they think did not read the job description or requirements.</p>

    <p>Many employers also use something known as an applicant tracking system (ATS). 
        This is an automated system that can be fine-tuned to reject applications. 
        Those applications are rejected that have missing information or do not have the right keywords. 
        <br>Even though you may not be able to completely predict what the ATS is looking for.
        You can still advance your application in the system by making sure to include the correct information.</p>

    <p>The relationships between education and employment are determined not only by the
         function of education to prepare learning for subsequent work tasks and other life spheres, 
         but also by the fact that education selects: in an educational meritocracy, the monetary 
         resources and the social recognitions are largely determined by the individuals' level of 
         educational attainment and their competencies fostered during the course of learning. 
         <br>The levels and the types of education, however, never are closely ‘matched’ to professional 
         positions and job requirements. Imperfections are unavoidable, because individuals have to be trained 
         to cope with imperfections and to be able to change employment and work themselves proactively. </p>

    <h3>2012-2015</h3>
    <h5>UNIVERSITY NAME</h5>
    <h6>Degree Level<br>University Location</h6>
    <p>Education dissociates the learner physically from work in order to prepare in a rational way for 
        coping with diversity of work and life tasks. Education has a qualifying function and a status-distributive 
        function for economy and society and is among various factors determining graduates' careers. 
        <br>Imperfect links between education and employment are due to limits in the identification of job requirements, 
        occupational dynamics, indeterminate work tasks of the highly qualified workforce, planning gaps, diverse curricular 
        concepts, and growing importance of lifelong education, whereby diverse value judgments come into play.</p>
