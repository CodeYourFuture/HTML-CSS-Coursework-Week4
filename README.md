# Make a website using Bootstrap's 12-column grid system

Choose one of the designs below, and re-create the design to perfection, using Bootstrap.

**Note:** Boostrap is already loaded into the `head` of index.html

## Responsive grid reminder

Follow Boostrap grid rules with care:

- Apply the `container` class to each of your page sections (unless you have a background image or colour that you want to bleed to the edges of the page at all times, in which case you should nest the container inside your full-width section)
- Wrap each set of elements inside a `row` class (this is your flex container!)
- Apply a column class (`col-[__]`) to the elements you want to place on the grid.
- If the column class doesn't specify a breakpoint (e.g. `col-md-6` uses the `md` breakpoint but `col-6` doesn't) then it will apply for all screen sizes (equivalent of `min-width: 0`).
- Don't change the width, padding or margin of the items that have a `col-[__]` class on them. This would clash with the Boostrap CSS.
