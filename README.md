### Responsive grid reminder

- Wrap each section of your page with a `container` (unless you have a background image that you want to bleed to the edges of the page at all times)
- Wrap each set of elements in a `row`
- Don't change the width, padding-left, padding-right, margin-left or margin-right of the items that have a `col-[x]` class on them.
