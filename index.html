        <h3>Quitting smoking is hard, but quit-smoking aids can boost your chance of success.</h3>
        <p>
            Want to stop smoking? Several quit-smoking products approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can help you stop for good.
            
            Using smoking-cessation products can greatly increase your chance of success. Only about 5 percent of people who try to quit tobacco succeed without a quit-smoking product. But more than 30 percent succeed when using one.
            
            Your chance of successfully quitting is even better when you combine behavior therapy with one or more quit-smoking products. You're more than twice as likely to quit smoking if you use prescription medication and professional support than if you try to quit on your own.</p>

        Tools & Tips  How To Quit  Using Nicotine Replacement Therapy

        Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is the most commonly used family of quit smoking medications. NRT reduces withdrawal feelings by giving you a small controlled amount of nicotine─but none of the other dangerous chemicals found in cigarettes. This small amount of nicotine helps satisfy your craving for nicotine and reduces the urge to smoke. 
        
        Doctors and other medical experts think NRT is the one of the most helpful tools smokers can use to quit. Some smokers have mild to moderate side effects. However, research shows that NRT is safe and effective. NRT can be an important part of almost every smoker’s quit smoking strategy.
        
        NRT comes in a variety of forms that are used in different ways. You can choose which forms you like best. Some NRT products work better than others for some people. Some people might prefer certain NRT products instead of others.
