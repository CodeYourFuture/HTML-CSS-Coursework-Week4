<h1>What Makes Us Different</h1>

<img src="images/log01.jpg" id="logo1">
<h3>Locally Sourced</h3>
<p>In the midst of our daily lives, we must find the juice to nourish our creative souls. 
Let your creative juices flow and don't be afraid to take chances! 
Breakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine. 
If life gives you lemons, make some kind of fruity juice.</p>

<img src="images/logo2.jpg" id="logo1">
<h3>100% Natural Ingredients</h3>
<p>It's true that 100% fruit juice is a good source of nutrients like vitamin C and potassium. ... 
Juice also doesn't contain the same fiber and phytonutrients that raw fruits have. 
That's why many experts recommend sticking to one juice serving per day.  

<img src="images/logo3.webp" id="logo1">
<h3>Just Picked Freshness</h3>
<p>They say juicing can reduce your risk of cancer, boost your immune system, remove toxins from your body, aid digestion and help you lose weight. 
However, there's no scientific evidence that extracted juices are healthier than the juice you get by eating the fruit or vegetable itself.

<h2>Boosting Immunity the Way Nature Intended</h2>
<p>Fruit juices vary in nutritional value, but most have a variety of health benefits. 
They contain various antioxidants that help reduce the risk of certain health issues and vitamins that help the body function well.
Some fruit juices also help combat problems, such as constipation, while cranberry juice can help prevent UTIs. 
Some fruit juices are also high in sugar and calories, meaning people should avoid consuming too much juice.
Too much sugar and calories can lead to weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.</p>

<h3>Soft & Creamy Organic Smoothies</h3>

<h3>The Power of Wellness Shots</h3>
<p>Although pure fruit juice does not contain added sugars such as those in sweetened drinks.
It does have fructose, which is a naturally occurring sugar.</p>
